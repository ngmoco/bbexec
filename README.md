This script will daemonize (background) an executable and then pass it on.
NOTE: if the -p(pid,pid-file) parameter is not set this script will attempt
to write one out to /var/run/daemon-basename if run as root and 
/usr/local/var/run/daemon-name if not run as root.

OPTIONS:

   -d       The executable to daemonize (background)
   -p       The pid file to output with the new daemons pid
   -l       The location to log stdout and stderr to
   -a       The quoted space delimeted list of arguments to pass through to the executable
   -v       Verbose
